# Get More Diners
A Smart Dashboard for Restaurant Owners to Boost Engagement with AI-Powered Promotions

## 🚀 Project Overview
Get More Diners is a web application designed to empower restaurant owners with AI-driven promotional tools. It enables them to create compelling offers, analyze diner data, and track campaign performance—all from a user-friendly dashboard.

## 🗄️ Database Overview
The backend is powered by a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase, using the default public schema. This schema is exposed via the Supabase Data API for seamless frontend integration.

### Current Tables
restaurants → Stores restaurant details (name, location, contact info).

diners → Contains diner records including name, email, and diner preferences.

offers → Holds promotional offers (title, description, start & end dates, linked to a restaurant).

campaigns → Tracks promotional campaigns, their status, and performance metrics.

## Example Relationship Diagram

A restaurant can create many offers.

An offer can belong to a campaign.

A diner can be targeted by multiple campaigns.

## Supabase Features in Use

Row Level Security (RLS): Ensures users can only access their own data.

Policies: Restrict access to authenticated users.

Supabase Data API: Simplifies communication between the frontend (Flask app) and database.

## 🔐 Security Considerations
To ensure data privacy and integrity, Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables within the public schema. This restricts access to data based on the user's authentication status and defined policies.

## 🧠 Key Features
AI-Generated Promotional Offers: Automatically generate creative and engaging promotional messages tailored to your restaurant's specials and target audience.

Diner Database: Maintain a comprehensive list of diners, including their contact information and preferences, to personalize marketing efforts.

Campaign History: Track past promotional campaigns, analyze their effectiveness, and refine future strategies.

Demo Mode: Experience the application's capabilities even without an API key, thanks to a built-in demo mode that simulates AI-generated content.
